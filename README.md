# TDD Example

This was completed using Visual Studio 2017, using C# and NUnit.

To execute the logic, run the tests.

I adopted a TDD approach to solving this Kata.

I took small "baby steps" to construct the code and a Red, Green, Refactor test rhythm.

## Notes

I've done this Kata many times before and have used it to teach others the techniques of TDD.

The surprising thing is I do it differently every time which I suppose is the genius of Katas!

I take great pride in writing good code, using the SOLID principles along with DRY and YAGNI. I hope you enjoy reading my commits and code!
